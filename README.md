> A handy script to find mac addresses found with kismet in a downloaded wigle csv.

## About

This script came about realizing that many vehicles and almost all mobile phones are a mobile wifi device that
can be picked up and logged by kismet. Then using wigle, a wardrive can be performed to collect a mapped read
out of all mobile devices in a given area. This script will then take logged mac addresses found with kismet
and search a wigle database for those devices. Thus, allowing association of a mobile device with a vehicle,
for educational purposes.

## Install

Only requests and pandas are needed as dependencies for the script. Requests being the most optional of the
two, being only used to access the wigle api.

Obviously, either poetry or pipenv are the recommended means of installation, as they establish a virtual
environment to install dependencies into and run the script from.

```sh
`poetry install`
# OR
`pipenv install`
# OR
`python -m pip install requests pandas`
```

### Configuration

This project uses a configuration script for setting variables that would be too burdensome to include in the
command line. Be sure to edit it and add the information required. This configuration file should be located
within the same folder your run the script from (i.e. the repository folder). Also a csv file is included in
the repository that provides a listing of all mac address prefixes as designated by the IEEE. This file should
also be left in the repository folder, but using a system maintained oui database is more preferred.

## Usage

The following options will output the help documentation for the script.

```sh
`poetry run python kismet-parser.py -h`
# OR
`pipenv run python kismet-parser.py -h`
# OR
`python kismet-parser.py -h`
```
